# Train

## Training Strategy

**Training Considerations**:

* Include plenty of examples with missing structures in your training set
* Use data augmentation to simulate various types of absence (surgical, congenital, pathological)
* Consider curriculum learning: start with easier cases and gradually introduce more challenging absence scenarios

The model learns:

* Spatial Priors: Where each structure should typically be located
* Feature-Attention Alignment: How strong features should correlate with high attention in normal cases
* Absence Patterns: What low alignment scores mean for different structures
* Conditional Segmentation: When to suppress segmentation based on absence predictions

## Key Components
1. **PyTorch Dataset Wrapper**

* Converts synthetic data to proper PyTorch format
* Handles data loading with batching and shuffling
* Includes optional augmentation transforms

2. **Comprehensive Metrics System**

* Presence Detection Metrics: Overall accuracy, per-structure accuracy, present/absent class accuracy
* Segmentation Metrics: Dice coefficients calculated only for present structures
* Per-Structure Analysis: Individual performance tracking for each anatomical structure

3. **Complete Training Loop**

* Proper train/validation splits with early stopping
* Gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling
* Checkpoint saving and loading
* Progress tracking with tqdm

4. **Visualization Tools**

* Training curve plotting (loss, accuracy, Dice scores)
* Prediction visualization showing original images, true/predicted segmentations, and attention maps
* Per-sample presence prediction analysis
